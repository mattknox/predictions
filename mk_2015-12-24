@mattknox's predictions as of the end of 2015:

# Politics
- donald trump will not win the nomination, will bitch about how he should have won, then will run as an independent, and democrats will win the presidency. (note-I know just about nothing about this, but it's fun to guess.)

- Finland will try their basic income experiment, and it will generally be considered a success.  (GDP will go up, poverty will of course go to 0, and crime will drop)

# Technology
- sam altman will be correct in his bet at http://blog.samaltman.com/bubble-talk
  (specifically,
  - uber+palantir+spaceX+dropbox+pinterest+airbnb will be worth $200B in aggregate on 2020-01-01
  - Stripe+Zenefits+Instacart+Mixpanel+Teespring+Optimizely+Coinbase+Docker+Weebly will be worth 27B on 2020-01-01
  - YC winter 2015 will be worth $3B on 2020-01-01
  )

## Cars
- cars that self-drive on highways (like the Tesla model S does now) will be available for consumer purchase at a $40K price-point by 2018-01-01.

- fully self-driving systems (defined as get in, tell it where to go, get outw provided either as a car ) will be available for consumer purchase by 2019-01-01

- a fleet of self-driving cars dispatched by network will replace at least 50% of the uber drivers in at least one market of population 100K+ by 2020-01-01

- fully autonomous network-dispatched fleets will operate in 10+ cities of 1M+ by 2025-01-01

- the legacy american car manufacturers (Ford, Chrysler, and GM) will either lose 90% of their market cap ($128B total) or no longer be independent companies by 2035
